# Square equation solver

### What this program do?
This is the my first program, which can solve square equation (with complex roots too!).
You can also test the program on your tests.

### How to install and run the Project?
You need to download all the files from github, compile and run them using the command line and ded's files.

### How to use the program?
You need to enter 3 numbers (a, b and c). They are coeffs of equation $`a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0`$.
